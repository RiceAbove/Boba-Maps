                    Boba Maps is a dynamic web application that helps you find local bubble tea shops in your area! Just simply type in an address in the search bar &amp; the site will quickly find shops in that location. It's desktop &amp; mobile friendly so you can find boba anywhere you go!

                  <h1 class="text-center">How does it work?</h1>

                    To make things simple, Boba Maps uses the Yelp API to get information about each bubble tea shop while using the Google Maps JavaScript API to add each shop onto the map. This way, you get information about the shops, and see it's given location on a map.&nbsp;
                  </p>

              <div class="intro">
                  <h1 class="text-center">Is this like Yelp?</h1>

              <div class="text">
                  <p>
                    No. The intent of this site is to not duplicate Yelp at all. This is a fun project that helped me learn full stack web development. This web application complies with the API terms of use of both the Yelp &amp; Google Maps API. None of the data that is being requested from these two services are cached, recorded, or pre-fetched. Boba Maps also meets the Yelp API display requirements.&nbsp;

                    Yes this site is completely free! You don't have to pay anything at all to use it. Even though it isn't necessary, you could always support me by buying me a coffee!
