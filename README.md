Find bubble tea restaurants in your area!

# UPDATE (March 7, 2021)
I just want to give a big thank you to everyone who has starred, forked, & tried out Boba Maps. I see Boba Maps as my first baby, since it is the very first web application that I've ever created. Since it's inception in 2019, it has gotten a lot of attention over at `/r/webdev`, and even to this day I am stil seeing people staring this repo. It means a lot to me that you guys found interest in my project, and I am very grateful for all of the support. I've ran out of free credits on Heroku & GCP so I will no longer be hosting this server to the cloud, and will also be archiving this repo. Even if Boba Maps has reach EOL, I will still be creating bigger & better projects in the near future. If you would like to collaborate, please reach out to me in my email that's on my GitHub profile. I wish everyone the best, and Godspeed!

## Acknowledgements
My girlfriend and I love boba, so I decided to make this fun project over to the summer so that we could quickly find bubble tea shops wherever we go. It's not intended to replace Yelp at all. This being my first web application, it still has a lot of work to be done to polish and scale it in the future.
