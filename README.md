## Acknowledgements
My girlfriend and I love boba, so I decided to make this fun project over to the summer so that we could quickly find bubble tea shops wherever we go. It's not intended to replace Yelp at all. This being my first web application, it still has a lot of work to be done to polish and scale it in the future. 

## Donation
This web app is completely free to use! It's not necessary, but you could always support me by buying me a coffee :-)
